                <p>
                    We decided to implement the popular game Tetris for our lab 5 project. We utilized an Adafruit SSD1351 OLED screen 
                    to display the game as well as a TV remote as the controller system. Upon powering up the board, the player is greeted 
                    with a welcome screen from which they must press a button to initiate the game (could be any of the registered buttons 
                    on the remote). Upon doing so, the game board is generated and pieces start falling one at a time from the top of the 
                    screen in the game board. The player must then play the game and try to maximize their score.
                </p>
                <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Game Rules</h2>
                <p>
                    The player must utilize the four arrow buttons on the remote to interact with a falling piece:
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul class="ml-4">
                    <li>Left:	move the falling piece one spot to the left</li>
                    <li>Right:	move the falling piece one spot to the right</li>
                    <li>Up:	rotate the falling piece clockwise by 90 degrees</li>
                    <li>Down: 	fast-place the falling piece where it would fall</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>
                    As falling pieces begin filling the board, one crucial rule is at play. When a row within the board is filled, it is 
                    cleared and all the pieces above it fall down into the cleared space. The objective of the game is to keep the board as clear 
                    as possible for as long as possible. The player’s score increases by 2 when a piece is placed and increases by 10 every time 
                    one row is filled up. The game is lost when a piece can not be placed on the board. This happens when the board is fully 
                    filled or simply if the player doesn’t move pieces quick enough. After a game is lost, the player’s score is saved and 
                    persistently stored using Amazon Web Services. A few seconds later, the top five highest scores ever achieved are displayed 
                    on the OLED screen next to the game board (see figure 1). If a player gets a score among the top five highest ones, it is 
                    highlighted red, and the player can feel proud of their accomplishment. The player can then choose to start a new game or 
                    disconnect the device.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Pausing</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The player can pause the game by pressing LAST on their remote. This clears the board so that the player can't cheat. If the 
                    player is ready to resume, they can press LAST again and the board will restore to its original state.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Reset</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The player can choose to press 0 on the remote to reset the whole game. This creates a new game for the player starting with 
                    a score of zero.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Cheats</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The player can press 1 on the remote three times to enable "cheat mode", which lets them see the board when they pause the game.
                </p>
